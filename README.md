**Chat application written using MEAN stack for Sealcode Workshops**

To run the application you need to have node.js along with npm.
Once you clone the repo: 


```
$ git clone git@github.com:michalStarski/sealcode-messenger.git
```


go to the root folder and run :


```
$ npm install
```


After that **run the same command in the /client directory**.

**This will install all required dependencies**

Now you are good to go!
Inside the root folder run

```
$ node app
```

And inside the **client** folder run

```
$ ng serve
```


That will start the application under address **http://localhost:4200**

Now you can create an account customize it and start chatting!
